        <p>Last Update: 26 - sept - 2025</p>
        <p className="text-3xl font-bold">1. INTRODUCTION</p>
        <p>
          Thank you for using CashPay and its associated services (the
          “Services”). CashPay (“we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) is a
          financial technology platform designed to make peer-to-peer payments,
          crypto transactions, and digital transfers fast and secure. Your
          privacy is of utmost importance to us, and we are committed to
          protecting and processing your personal data in accordance with
          applicable data protection and privacy laws. This Privacy Policy
          explains what data we collect from you, why we collect it, how we use
          it, and how you can exercise your rights regarding your data. By
          accessing or using our Services, you agree to the practices described
          in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this policy, you
          should stop using the Services immediately. We may update this Privacy
          Policy from time to time to reflect changes in law, technology, or our
          business practices. When we make material changes, we will notify you
          through the Platform, email, or other reasonable means. Your continued
          use of the Services after such updates constitutes your acceptance of
          the updated Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p className="text-3xl font-bold">2. WHAT PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT</p>
        <p>
          We collect several categories of data to provide and improve the
          Services. This may include information you provide directly,
          information we collect automatically when you use the Platform, and
          information from third parties such as KYC/AML verification providers.
          Personal data you provide directly during onboarding or while using
          the Services may include your full legal name, government-issued
          identification details (e.g., CNIC, passport number, NICOP), gender,
          date and place of birth, nationality, residential address, and country
          of residence. We may also collect your email address, phone number,
          bank account details, and blockchain wallet address. During KYC and
          compliance checks, we may request supporting documents such as utility
          bills, proof of income, or business registration documents.
          Additionally, we collect transaction history, including amounts,
          counterparties, dates, and times of transfers, as well as spending
          patterns that help us detect fraud and improve user experience. We may
          also collect technical data such as IP address, device identifiers,
          browser type, operating system, geolocation data, and activity logs to
          ensure platform security and optimize performance. This data helps us
          investigate suspicious activities and protect your account from
          unauthorized access.
        </p>
        <p className="text-3xl font-bold">3. HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</p>
        <p>
          We use your personal data strictly for legitimate business purposes
          and to fulfill our contractual and legal obligations. This includes
          verifying your identity, conducting KYC and AML checks, processing
          payments, and facilitating transactions.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Your data allows us to operate, maintain, and improve the CashPay
          platform, including providing technical support, responding to
          inquiries, and tailoring features to your preferences. We also use
          your information to generate transaction confirmations, invoices, and
          account statements. In addition, we monitor transactions and account
          activity to detect fraud, suspicious behavior, or prohibited
          activities. Your data may also be used to carry out internal audits,
          compliance reviews, and risk assessments. If you have opted in, we may
          send you promotional materials, newsletters, or product updates. You
          can withdraw consent for marketing communications at any time, but
          operational and security-related notifications will still be sent as
          they are essential for your account. Finally, we use anonymized and
          aggregated data for analytics, service improvement, and business
          intelligence to better understand trends and enhance user experience.
        </p>
        <p className="text-3xl font-bold">4. SHARING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</p>
        <div>
          <p>
            We value your trust and do not sell your personal data. However, to
            provide and improve our Services, we may share your data with
            carefully selected third parties under strict confidentiality
            obligations. These may include:
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-7 marker:text-white">
            <li>
              Service providers such as payment processors, banks, KYC/AML
              verification vendors, cloud hosting services, analytics tools, and
              customer support partners.
            </li>
            <li>
              Regulators and law enforcement authorities when required to comply
              with legal, regulatory, or tax obligations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Professional advisers including auditors, lawyers, and compliance
              consultants engaged by us to meet governance standards.
            </li>
            <li>

            <li>

              receive promotional communications.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            We may also disclose personal data to prevent fraud, protect the
            rights and security of our users, enforce our Terms of Use, or in
            connection with mergers, acquisitions, or business transfers where
            your data may be part of the transferred assets.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p className="text-3xl font-bold">5. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</p>
        <p>
          Because CashPay operates in multiple jurisdictions, your data may be
          transferred to and stored on servers located outside of your home
          country. These jurisdictions may have data protection laws that are
          different, and sometimes less protective, than those in your country.
          When we transfer data internationally, we take appropriate steps to
          ensure your data receives an adequate level of protection, such as
          implementing encryption, access controls, and contractual data
          protection clauses with third parties handling your data.
        </p>
        <p className="text-3xl font-bold">6. DATA RETENTION</p>
        <p>
          We retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the
          purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and to comply with applicable
          laws. For example, financial regulations may require us to store
          transaction data for a minimum period (e.g., 5–7 years) to meet audit
          and tax obligations. After the retention period expires, your data
          will either be securely deleted, anonymized, or stored in a form that
          does not identify you personally, unless further retention is required
          for legal claims, fraud prevention, or dispute resolution.
        </p>
        <p className="text-3xl font-bold">7. MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS</p>
        <p>
          We may send you marketing messages, including offers, promotions, and
          product updates, if you have provided consent through the Platform.
          These communications aim to keep you informed about new features,
          campaigns, and opportunities to use CashPay more effectively. You may
          withdraw consent for marketing at any time by following the
          unsubscribe instructions in the email or contacting us at (EMAIL) .
          Please note that important account-related notifications, such as
          security alerts, policy updates, or service disruptions, cannot be
          opted out of.
        </p>
        <p className="text-3xl font-bold">8. COOKIES AND TRACKING TECHNOLOGY</p>
        <p>
          CashPay uses cookies and similar tracking technologies to personalize
          your experience, remember login sessions, improve performance, and
          detect fraudulent activity. Cookies may also be used to measure
          marketing effectiveness and enhance platform usability. You can adjust
          your browser settings to refuse or delete cookies; however, some
          features of the Services may not function properly without them. We do
          not currently respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals, but we
          continue to review this technology and may update our approach in the
          future.
        </p>
        <p className="text-3xl font-bold">9. DATA SECURITY</p>
        <p>
          We take your data security seriously and use multiple layers of
          protection, including SSL encryption, secure cloud infrastructure,
          firewalls, and continuous monitoring for suspicious activity.
          Two-factor authentication (2FA) is strongly encouraged to secure your
          account from unauthorized access.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Despite these measures, no system is completely immune to breaches. By
          using our Services, you acknowledge that transmission of data over the
          internet carries inherent risks, and we cannot guarantee absolute
          security.
        </p>
        <p className="text-3xl font-bold">10. THIRD-PARTY LINKS</p>
        <p>
          Our Platform may include links to third-party websites or
          applications. Clicking these links may allow third parties to collect
          data about you. We do not control and are not responsible for the
          privacy practices of third parties. We recommend reviewing their
          privacy policies before sharing any information with them.
        </p>
        <p className="text-3xl font-bold">11. MINORS</p>
        <p>
          CashPay does not knowingly offer Services to individuals under the
          legal age of majority. If we discover that a minor has provided
          personal data to us without parental consent, we will delete such data
          immediately. Parents or guardians may contact us to request deletion
          of any data accidentally collected from a minor.
        </p>

        <p className="text-3xl font-bold">12. YOUR RIGHTS</p>
        <p>
          Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to request access
          to the personal data we hold about you, request corrections, restrict
          processing, or ask for deletion. You may also have the right to data
          portability and to withdraw previously given consent. To exercise
          these rights, please email (EMAIL ADDRESS) with the subject line “Data
          Request.” We may verify your identity before fulfilling your request
          to protect your data. Certain requests may be denied if required by
          law (e.g., retaining data for regulatory compliance).{" "}
        </p>
